# Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle

The Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequenceâ€”in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence. The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain. The algorithm produces an unbiased permutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them in place.
